        Wicklet is a playground for hacking Wicket and GWT. Wicket is a Java web applications framework that use plain
        Java with HTML templates to provide a component model and handle client/server interactions. With full power of
        the Java programming language, it is much easier to create custom components, add behaviors, and create highly
        interactive AJAX enabled web applications. GWT is a Java to Javascript compiler that allows client side logic
        to be coded in Java. It also provide a client side UI framework. Wicklet consists of a number of sub-projects
        that hacks, enhances or uses Wicket and GWT.
